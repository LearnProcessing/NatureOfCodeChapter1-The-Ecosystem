# NatureOfCodeChapter1-The-Ecosystem
Implement basic Object-Oriented Programming and vectors concept to simulate real-world behaviour of a creature. such as swimming fish, nervous fly, and scary cocroach. I tried to give the creature a personality through not only its visual deisgn, but also its behavior.

HOW TO RUN THE SIMULATION:
Put all the .pde files into a folder. Run the Ecosystem_Force.pde using processing.pde apps.
